        The concept of responsive design is optimizing the user interface to create a better user
        experience regardless of their devices, such as smartphones, tablets, desktops, or laptops.
        CSS helps to maintain the responsive design through layout adjustments. Additionally, HTML
        provides the structures by using elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Responsive design affects the development of web technology. It is important for everyone to
        have access to a web page, no matter what kind of device they use. HTML provides elements to
        help build a webpage. CSS has features to make different kinds of styles based on device
        characteristics. JavaScript enhances the responsive design experience by providing dynamic
        features. The more different devices come out, the more important it is that user
        experiences are equally optimized.

        I learned about a meta tag. The meta tag is one of the HTML elements used to provide
        information about the data, which is called meta data. The meta tag is crucial to improving
        web app accessibility. I used all html files on this milestone such as index.html,
        product_register.html, reflection.html, and honesty. html. The meta tag allows the
        consistency of the web page. It is not only effecient for programmers, but also for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        The css file shares the idea of web designing which means it does not have to start from
        scratch. There are different kinds of css that we can use such as water.css, style.css and
        holiday.css. By using CSS files, the programmers do not have think about how it looks and
        they can more focus on the web page itself. Additionally, we talked about validation as well
        on this milestone. It is important to let users chance to put valid inputs before moving to
        next step. The validation reduces the possibility of wrong inputs by user's mistakes. The
        computer does not make mistakes, human does. So, the JavaScript validation helps users to
        write down only valid input. Therefore, it is beneficial when analyze the user data.

        I want to address my learning experience through this course, WEB222. I have never learned
        web programming before. So, I was worried at first. However, it was more interesting than I
        thought. There are so many things to experiment with in my own way using HTML, JavaScript,
        and CSS. We learned JavaScript first, HTML, and CSS. I enjoyed HTML the most personally. It
        is because JavaScript was a new concept for me to learn, and CSS has too much freedom to
        design. As a web programmer, not a web designer, it was uncomfortable for me to design in my
        own way. I realized that I am more programmer type person rather than designer.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it was a great opportunity for me to learn how to be creative in web development.
        Until now, the courses focused more on coding itself. Then, through this WEB 222 course, I
        could learn more about web page design, like front-end. It was interesting for me that it
        was obvious to change design for better web experiences for clients.
